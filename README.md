This whole repository is build on the codes provided by University of Asia Pacific University, Data Structure & Algorithm-II (DSA-II) faculty named Md. Shahidul Islam (MSI). 
All these codes were implimented in the lab classes barehandedly and the faculty tried his best to make us understand the core of these codes. 
All these codes' credit are goes to him directly. 
I only assambled those codes here directly from his classes and transform them from C to C++ for the users help. 
I would be very honored if these codes might help you in any circomstences. 
Thank you for visiting.
